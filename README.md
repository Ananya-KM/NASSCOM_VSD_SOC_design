## PHYSICAL DESIGN IN VLSI
</P> Physical design in VLSI is the process of converting a circuit's high-level description into a detailed physical layout on silicon. It involves steps like partitioning, floorplanning, placement, routing, and verification to optimize performance, area, power, and manufacturability. The goal is to create a layout that can be fabricated into a functional chip.

## WORKSHOP CONTENTS
1.Introduction to open source eda tool(openlane) and PDK(skywater130nm).

2.Floorplan and Powerplan.

3.Cell design using Magic Layout and Ngspice characterization.

4.Pre-layout timing analysis and importance to good clock tress(i.e minimum skewness).

5.Final steps for RTL2GDS flow.

The Arduino Uno board features a processor as the primary component of interest. The physical design will focus on the macro within the processor, implementing a block-level design.
The image below displays the microcontroller board or PCB with various components arranged on it.
